I had made some progress and then screwed it up by deleting a directory through terminal on accident - I made a folder that already existed and then tried to delete it and deleted the wrong one - and hadn't done a commit in a long time.  Like, days.  Basically just had to pull down my code from when it was barely done.")

Right now trying to do it on my own, I feel like I look at code and my brain shuts off.  I know I need to reach out for help, but.  I keep letting anxiety get the best of me.  So.  Basically, I feel like an idiot, and I'm scared that I'm falling behind.  But giving up on this assignment to try to move on to the next ones.  Just wanted to acknowledge that before you grade it.  I'm sorry.")
